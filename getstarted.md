**JAX Long-Read Sequencing Workshop  - APR 23 - 25** 

<br/>

## Goals
* Connect to a cloud instance in aws
* Use ```ssh``` for connecting to remote machine
* Check the available resources and file system on the remote machine

### Setting up

These instructions will walk you through steps needed to connect to a remote machine "an instance" on **Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2 instance**.

### Connecting to a remote computer on Amazon EC2

For this workshop, the instructors have already launched the remote machines for use. Please use the instance assigned to you. Each instance has an IP address listed which is needed to connect to that machine directly. You will need your user id and password to login securely to the machine.

### The Shell
The *shell* is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination. **The *shell* is an interpreter that helps translate our input into computer language.**

There are many reasons to learn about the shell.

* For most bioinformatics tools, you have to use the shell. There is no graphical interface. If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics you're going to need to use the shell.
* The shell gives you *power*. The command line gives you the power to do your work more efficiently and
more quickly.  When you need to do things tens to hundreds of times,
knowing how to use the shell is transformative.
* Computational resources that can handle large datasets, such as remote computers or cloud computing, require a working knowledge of Unix.

We will be using the shell on our laptops to connect to the cloud. **How do we access the shell?**

### **Mac users**

The shell is already available on Mac and Linux computers. 

On Mac the shell is available through Terminal
	`Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal`

Simply search for 'Terminal' and/or look for the terminal icon.<br> 
![terminal icon](https://github.com/snamburi3/workshop/blob/gh-pages/img/terminal.png?raw=true)

1. Open the terminal and type the following command substituting 'ip_address' for the IP address your instructor will provide. *Be sure to pay attention to capitalization and spaces*

        $ ssh your-username@ip_address
        
2. You will receive a security message that looks something like the message below. Type 'yes' to proceed.

        The authenticity of host 'ec2-52-91-14-206.compute-1.amazonaws.com (52.91.14.206)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:S2mMV8mCThjJHm0sUmK2iOE5DBqs8HiJr6pL3x/XxkI. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

3. In the final step, you will be asked to provide a login and password. **Note:** When typing your password, it is common in Unix/Linux not see see any asterisks (e.g. ****) or moving cursors. Just continue typing.
4. You should now be connected!

#### **Windows users**

> *Prerequisites*: You must have an SSH client. There are several free options and we will use PuTTY [[Download Putty.exe](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)]

For Windows, you will have downloaded a separate program called PuTTy to allow you to use the shell. 

1. Open PuTTY; In the 'Host Name (or IP address)' section paste in the IP address provided by your instructor (or the ip address of an instance you have provisioned yourself). *Keep the default selection 'SSH' and Port (22)*. <br>
![Putty Image](https://github.com/snamburi3/workshop/blob/gh-pages/img/putty_screenshot_1.png?raw=true)
2. Click 'Open' and you will be presented with a security warning. Select 'Yes' to continue to connect. <br>
![Putty security screen](https://github.com/snamburi3/workshop/blob/gh-pages/img/putty_screenshot_2.png?raw=true)
3. In the final step, you will be asked to provide a login and password. **Note:** When typing your password, it is common in Unix/Linux not see see any asterisks (e.g. ****) or moving cursors. Just continue typing.<br>

4. You should now be connected!


### **Verifying your connection and environment** 

When you connect, it is typical to receive a welcome screen. The Data Carpentry Amazon instances display this message upon connecting:


```
